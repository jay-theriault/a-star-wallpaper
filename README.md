# A* Desktop Background (Lively Wallpaper) — Prototype

This is a web (HTML/Canvas) prototype intended to be loaded by **Lively Wallpaper** on Windows.

## Run locally (dev)
Open `index.html` directly in a browser.

## Notes
- This prototype uses a simple grid graph inside the Greater Boston bounding box and animates A* exploration (open/closed sets) at ~20 steps/sec.
- Road-network (OSM) integration is a later step.
